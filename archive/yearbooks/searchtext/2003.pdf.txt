President's Message

Charles Dickens wrote, “one always begins to
forget a place as soon
as it’s left behind.” We are fortunate to have
this edition of the
“Crusader Yearbook” to preserve Our mem
ories of the 2002-2003
school year. As I reflect on the school year
, lam reminded of the

classes, courses, clubs, teams, and
special events that comprised

each school day. The pages of this yea
rbook accurately reflect
the good times, the funny times and
even the boring times! I
would like to thank the members
of the yearbook club for their
efforts in producing this keepsake.
Your dedication and hard
work is sincerely appreciated.
In closing, I would like to extend
my sincere best wishes to our
graduates. May the days you spe
nt at Char-Lan allow you to be
confident and competent in wha
tever you pursue.
Sincerely,
Frank Hummel]

Editor's Message

Taking on the role of yearbook editor is possibly one of the scariest
things I’ve ever done. At first I had no clue as to what I was doing,
so this job has been an incredible learning experience for me. I’m
extremely grateful for all the patience and support shown to me, and
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their help
throughout the year, particulary Mrs. David, Mrs. Vanderburg,
Sharon, Cathy, Christine, the inexhaustible yearbook staff, and my
fearless leader, Corey Kalsi. Finally, thank you Char-Lan. Without

your memories and contributions, this book would not be possible.
To paraphrase the Beatles, what you get out of life is equal
to what
you put into it. I hope you look back on this year with
pride.
Keep Smiling!

power and it was not yet noon. Large, puffy, snow white clouds glided
through the sky, changing shape and form smoothly. My attention
turned back to the foal in time to see him quicken his light, springy step.
His long spider-like legs moved with ease over the ground. He coyly
turned his head and gazed at me for several moments. The little foal was
deciding if I was safe to approach, with this funny object in my hand. He
gave a little toss of his head and his short spiky mane danced aroiund his
neck. His tail was twitching back and forth as he slowly angled toward
me. He decided to give a little bounce and came towards me. Slowly and
cautiously he made his way towards me and my funny object. He
stopped short a couple of feet from me. I had my camera poised and my
finger ready. The curious foal stretched out his neck towards my camera.
His ears were forward and the expression was captured on my funny
little object forever.
-Christine Sandilands, OAC

TO
To be faithful is easy
To be romantic is feeling
To be unbelievably attractive is unknowing
To be completely sexy without knowing it is attractive
To be one of a kind is unique
To bea soul mate is fate
To understand your partner, inside and out is desirable
To dream of them is heart fluttering
To think of them constantly is
normal
To be an outrageous babe is not your fault
To connect is incredible
To gaze into their warm eyes is a privilege
To hold your partner is adorable
To gift each other with your presence is unbelievable
To whisper in their ear is fascinating
To touch their warm skin is forgiving
To kiss them passionately is forever yours
To dance is a dream
To see inside them is self-explanatory
To love them is priceless
-Natasha Arsenault, Grade 11

First Impressions
Leaving elementary school behin;

and coming to Char-Lan was q

great experience. Here at Chay.
Lan, everyone is helpful ang
willing to lend a hand. The

kindness of this school makes the

transition that much easier. Whe,

many people think of high schoo;
they think of bullies, gangs, ang

Con gratule ations to the
Class

of 2003 from your

friends at

drugs; not at Char-Lan, though,

When people at Char-Lan descrip,
their school, they think of friends,
the sports teams, the clubs, and
most of all, the great times they

have had at this great little schoo),

Char-Lan is the most welcoming
high school you will ever find,
and Char-Lan is by far better than
the rest!

-Tyler MacDougall, Grade 9

10 HICK THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU...
[hate your county way,
And the country things you say.
Thate the country way you talk,
And the country way you walk.
I hate how you always yell, “yee haw”,

And how the birds on your farm go, “caw.”

Purina Chows & Pet Food - Specialty Lawn Fertilizer & Seed
- Farm Fertilizers - Precision AG Services - NK Brand Corn,
Soybean & Forage Seed - Custom Field Application.

[hate the way you grow your hair,
And the cowboy hat you wear.
I hate your flannel shirts.
I hate your overalls.
T especially hate those cowboy boots,
And how you play the guitar instead of the flute.

I hate how you drive a pick-up truck,

Now why is your nickname, “Cluck”?
Thate the farm you live on,
And the chores you do each day.
I hate the horses that you ride,
And how you always lie.
Thate how you milk the cows,

And your bushy uni-brow.

[hate all the trees on your lawn,
And the waking up at dawn,
[hate the country way you laugh,
And the country way you cry.
T really hate that you're a cowboy.
But mostly I hate the fact that I can’t
hate you,
Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at abl
