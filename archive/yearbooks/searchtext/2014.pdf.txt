Student Council put on a carnival week in
February. It all began on Tuesday with Twin
Day and a Performance by Graham Greere
followed on Wednesday with "Show your
Team Canada" Spirit Day as the winter
Olympics was taking place in Sochi, Russia
and over lunch we had a live streaming of
men's hockey Canada vs. Latvia
Quarterfinals. Next on Thursday, was our
Mardi Gras Masquerade Semi-Formal Dance
for grades 8-12 and we topped it off with a
Friday Outdoor Sports Day which was
postponed to the following Friday due to a
snow day (no school). Students had a choice
of skating on the Rideau Canal or supporting
the boys hockey team by cheering them on in
their last game.
All in all - a great Carnival
week!

Thanks to the generosity of the Healthy Eating for Better
Learning (HEBL) program, students were provided with a free
breakfast every Wednesday morning. Approximately 60
students took advantage of this second year initiative. Under
the guidance of Ms. Mason and Ms. Gordon, an assortment of
fresh muffins, fruit, toast, pancakes, juice, milk and hot
chocolate were offered.

As well fresh fruit donated by Leahy Orchards of Quebec
(apples & apple sauce) and Alexandria IGA (variety of fruit at
cost) was distributed daily to all classes by student helpers Ben

& Brandon Lafave. Everyone involved is very thankful for the

generous donations and success of the program.

On Wednesday, September 25th, Envirothon students

after school. Students tackled

various art projects such as
painting classroom doors and
helping with stage sets for the
drama club. They were given
opportunities to try art forms not

A fundraiser comprising of
creating and selling art for paint
took place in December. The club
allowed for like people to hang
out and be creative.

500 individual pieces of trash! This analyzation can
help educate Canadians about the scale and
consequence of global marine debris.

Envirothon allows students to learn about the
environment and compete against other high schools

Free the Children is an international
charity and educational partner, working
to empower and enable youth to be
agents of change. Char-Lan's club has
been busy creating awareness of
poverty and local issues.
On Halloween many our members
collected non-perishable food items
instead of candy for a Jocal food bank.
There were nearly 625 separate items
brought to support local families!
Our Free the Children group is currently
supporting Rural China, which is often
one of the most commonly disregarded
places supported by Free the Children.
We chose it for exactly that reason! We
have sent nearly 500 dollars just in
donations to the cause.
Free the Children also got to attend "We
Day", which is a big inspirational
concert with many famous guests. It is
meant to uplift youth to continue to help
others. You don't simply receive these
tickets, you have to earn them and we
eally believe that we have!

Annually, we sell our famous OSAID
Kapow lollypops! This year, we sold the

We are all proud to be’an OSAID
