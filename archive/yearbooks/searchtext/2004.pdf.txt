Message

After all the stress, work, and meetings that come

sy

essage |

goodbye to Char-Lan, my roots are now here and I

will always come home.

“The real magic is enthusiasm.
It spells the difference between
mediocrity and accomplishment.”

I would like to thank Mr. Trasuk and Mr. D. for

having patience with all the last minute meetings.
Also, thank you to Mr. Hummell

Elbert Hubbard

and being there for me and the rest of the students.
You will be greatly missed. Without the secretaries
and custodians I would have been lost - you are
angels! With all the changes being made to the
teaching staff it is hard to keep up, but I would like
to say thank you to each and every one of you.
Thank you to all the teachers who say down and
listened to me when I needed to vent. Real teachers
don’t just teach subjects like Math or English, but
they teach life lessons - to all of us. You have
brought me to a new height in my life. You will not
be forgotten.

We are fortunate to have this edition of the
“Crusader Yearbook” to preserve our memories of the 2003-2004 school year. It was
certainly a busy and exciting year filled with a
good number of special events and spirit
related activities. I would like to congratulate
Mr. Blois and the yearbook staff for their
enthusiasm and dedication in creating this
treasured time piece. Through their efforts
they have captured the essence of our school
and many memories for us to enjoy in the
future.
The staff and

students

of Char-Lan wish to
thank

Mr. Hummell for his
dedication

to the school over
the years. Bestof

luck in your new
appointment.

Sincerely,
Frank Hummel

with being President, I would have to say that this
message will be the hardest duty for me. I have
spent five amazing years at Char-Lan and I guess
this is it. I will miss all the great times here with
everyone, from my favourite grade nines to all the
OACs that came before me. I could never say

“Are you sure this is the right way?”

“Crusader Quest at La Petite Rouge was an
eventful three-day adventure. Everything ran
smoothly, the leadership skills and spirit
brought back to the school were infectious,

The event would also not have been such a
success without the help of our energetic Skill
Builders and devoted Committee. Some great
memories, such as Paula, Simon, Randy, and

the shower curtain were made, and these are

among many that will stay with us forever,

St. Andrew’s Day, November 30th 2003

St. Andrew’s Day was a stunning success this year,
with numerous activities to fill up everyone’s spirits
with Scottish cheer. At the morning assembly, School
Board Trustee Art Buckland presented the Ode to the
Haggis, offering a tartan, a tribute, and a taste of the
Haggis for all. The MacCulloch Dancers wowed
us with a number of performances, and many students
and staff displayed their poetic and musical talents to
the audience.

Kamous Last Words

Good evening parents, teachers, guests and fellow graduates. I have been chosen by my fellow graduates to speak to you tonight
on their behalf and I am honoured to represent the class of 2004, the 50" graduating class to come out of Char-Lan District High
School.
As I look around the gym, I can’t believe it has been 5 years. All the memories come back, along with the good times, and
maturing as individuals. It seems like only yesterday that Mr. Oathwaite was cooking up some hot dogs in the courtyard for grade 9
orientation day. The first time we came to Char-Lan we thought it was so big, and some of us actually got lost. Now 5 years later we
realize why Char-Lan’s motto is small enough to know you large enough to serve you, because we have a small school but we have the
courses that give us the education we need to be able to do whatever we want in the future. This can be said about our athletic
department as well, as we continue to expand our athletic options with the inauguration of senior boys rugby, which helped boys to
become men and the constant encouragement from their coach left the fans in awe as he would constantly say, “ruck or die.” Who can
forget the girls soccer game last year where they beat Glengarry District on the soccer field with their hair and nails done, and just
hours later were at prom looking amazing in their high heels and elegant dresses. We never do get tired of beating G.D. And if you
think that was bad they ended up doing it again this year too. Its memories like these that we’ll look back and laugh at.
Our graduating class started a lot of activities in the last couple years that will last a long time here at Char-lan, for instance
two years ago Crusader Quest was born. This was a chance for us to have fun and learn about others. It was a definite success. This
allowed everyone to truly get to know others at Char-Lan and allowed some of the graduates to provide leadership to the grades below
us. And who will forget about the St-Andrew’s day celebration, where everyone got to feel Scottish for a day and eat some haggus.
Or how about Char-Lan’s first ever Fear Factor, where some of the graduates had a chance to win some money by eating some out of
the ordinary dishes, like cat food and green peppers. And who will forget the time we had a hypnotist in this year and Andree Beaupre
made an acceptance speech for an Emmy she supposedly got, pushing Michelle Leblanc out of the way to get it. And finally after 5
years we changed the odd troll mural to the one we have today thanks to our artistic students. One of the biggest changes we all went
through in the last 5 years was the new curriculum. The 40 community service hours, the new textbooks... and like we didn’t already
have enough tests we had to pass a literacy test as well. And all 89 of us did this to be able to receive our high-school diploma.
But the graduating class isn’t the only thing leaving Char-Lan this year, as Frank Hummell our principal is leaving us as well.
Mr. Hummell was not just a principal to us he was a friend who understood our problems, most of the time. Char-Lan will miss his
leadership and friendship in future years. I would also like to thank our parents and teachers for supporting us, believing in us, and
encouraging us. It is because of you that we have made it this far. So on behalf of the entire class I would like to say thank you. Thank

;

you for teaching us and helping us become who we are today.
We might be going our separate ways for the next 5 or so, but chances are we'll all probably come back to the place where we

grew up. Growing up here in Glengarry is special because it is where the people are kind, the parties are fun, and the memories last a

lifetime. Being a student at Char-Lan is much the same. We might not have the biggest school or highest budget but we use what we
have the best we can.
