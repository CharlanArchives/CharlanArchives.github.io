As a Glengarrian, it has been an honour and a delight to have been the principal of Char-Lan District
High School this year.

“It takes a Village (and Volunteers) to raise a child”.
itis wonderful being in the midst of a community that is so supportive of its school initiatives. Our
school partnerships are a very important dimension of Char-Lan’s success. Thank you to everyone
who volunteered their time and talents this year and a special thank you the yearbook crew for
capturing a lifetime of memories.

activities and events that

everyone would enjoy. This
year was no Clfferent,
student council ran many
spirit days, blue and gold

day, twin day, PJ day,etc...,
activities like selling pizza

busy selling ads, taking

and drinks in ihe cafeteria
and special evenis like
carnival week finishing with

a semi-formal Much Music

~ Char-Lan Fundraises for Terry Fox Day
Char-Lan DHS held ifs annual Terry Fox Run on

Friday, September 19th. We scheduled for the

19th rather than the National Schoo] Run Day in

orderto maximize participation. (sporting
activities on the 24th). Student participation was
once again at an all time high. We had two
female students, Ally Lecky and Maddie Fox cut
their hair for cancer, and Sheehan Danaher

shaved his head too. Staff raised over $500 and

as a result, teacher Andy Rorabeck shaved his
beard and Karl Armstrong, shaved his head,
Together over $3450 was raised for the Terry Fox
Foundation.

Well done Crusaders!
