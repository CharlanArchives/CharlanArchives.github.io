W. hope you enjoy the yearbook as much as
we've enjoyed producing it for you. We have
incorporated all grades from 7 to 12 this year. We
are united as a school!

O. student council is devoted to providing
fellow students with a positive and friendly
atmopshere throughout the school year. Our
composed team of students from grade 9-12,
led by Mrs.Fontaine and Mrs. Vanderburg met
each week to discuss and plan events. We
raised funds to give students the chance to
participate in events such as dances and spirit
days throughout the year. Student council
would like to thank all of the students for their
support this year.

It was fun getting together, discussing themes,
taking pictures and putting it all together. Special
thanks to teacher advisors Mr. Blois and Mr.
O'Farrell as well as parent volunteer, Mrs.
DeRochie for their help and the many advertisers
who have supported us which greatly helps reduce
the cost of the book.

Helen Gauthier & James Edwardson

Enjoy the book!

See you in September.

Vice-Principal'ls Message
As I sit down to write this, it is hard to believe that my first year
as vice-principal at Char-lan is coming to a close. I hope that
when you look back at the 2012-13 school year, you remember
the people who encouraged you to be your best, the friends you
laughed with and the good times you had. In the years to come,
as the memories fade, I hope you pull out this year's Crusader
and smile.

Congratulations to the yearbook committee for their dedication
and hard work showcasing all that we have to offer at Char-Lan.
Best of luck to the graduating class of 2013! The opportunities
that await you are endless. For everyone who is returning to
Char-Lan, I look forward to seeing each and every one in
September.

Char-Lan students celebrated Remembran
ce Day
this year with a very special speaker. Patri
ck
MacCulloch visited Char-Lan to speak of his
Canadian Armed Forces career that spanned over
20 years and numerous countries. Beginning his

career in infantry in Petawawa, Patrick visited

countries on missions representing the Canadian
Armed Forces and was active in both
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

Patrick's goal was to allow students to put a face
to Canadian Soldiers so they might be able to
relate better to what out Armed Forces’ soldiers
do on a daily basis. Patrick was born in Glen
Roy and attended Char-Lan High School in the
1980's.
ee

es

Gia. DHS hosted a school fundraiser
which consi
onsist
sted of 1 km w alk, 5 & 10 Km run/walk.
The event was timed by SportStats. The
event was organized by the student counc
il alon g withit Principle John Danaher and Hilda Stukenboom,
Chair of School Council. Therew® |
over $2 500 raised for Char-Lan. The
money w as divided between the 7 &
8 and the
9 to 12 student councils.

Patrick's speach along with the Last Post, The
Reveille, grade 7/8 band and a grade 7/8 skit
about a veteran returning home to his family after
the war, rounded out our ceremony.
Thanks to Patrick MacCulloch again for taking

the time to share his very interesting career with
our students, it was greatly appreciated by all.
