This year we had brand new lockers

installed. The grade 12 biology class
gained some new pets, and the grade 10

Civics class held their own election! Our
sports teams played very well. Some

students held a barbeque in the parking lot!
Char-Lan had a great 2018-19 school year!

Vice Principal's Message

This yearbook is the product of a tremendous amount of time and effort on the part of a small number of students
and staff -- thank you. Our high school years are a significant part of our journey through life as we establish and

build friendships that we will cherish for many years.

| :

Shannon Prevost
Jennifer Robinson
Margaret St. John Boekhoff
Frances Vanderburg

We interact with our peers each day in our classes and gain

knowledge that we will use for years to come. All of us, at some point in the future, will open this publication and |

Rick Landry
Glenn Daye
Shirley Deschamps

remember the friendships, relationships, ideas, leadership and experiential learning opportunities and events that

aré now so much a part of our lives. In essence, this book reflects a snapshot of our time spent here at Char-Lan.

and through
extra-curricular activities -- get involved! This is your school and these are your memories! To all our
graduates
of 2019, I wish you good health and much success in your future endeavours, and I leave you
with a quote from
Ralph Waldo Emerson on his definition of success:

To laugh often and much; to win therespect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
of honest critics and to endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find

the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child,

to earn the appreciation

the best in others; to leave

a garden patch or a redeemed social condition.
To know eve®
one life has breathed easier because you have
lived. This is to have succeeded.

Carpe Diem!
Mrs. MacGillis
Vice Principal

deserve some
