Crusader Quest has to be the hardest three days any one ever has to endure. You get your
face covered with pudding, have to listen to Mr. Power talk about his Great Island, watch
Christina mock David Beckham, and the guys always seem so down to earth. Really it's

hard to deal with.

But its also unforgettable!

A Few Final Words, The

President's Address

of Your
Beloved
Yearbook

This has been an awesome and extremely successful year for Char-Lan! This year student’s council was able to
distribute more money to sports teams and to clubs than ever imagined in previous years. The money collected from

the student fees and the chocolate bar sales allowed numerous student breakfasts, a hypnotist, and many EOSSA

and OFSAA getaways.

I would like to take this opportunity to encourage everyone to participate in student council and to perhaps run for
president. I am sure that there are a many students who are more intelligent and creative than I who would be able
to inspire new traditions and offer new entertaining twists on a few of the older ones.
As a council we did our very best to provide a fun and interesting year. I would like to thank Jessie Cattanach,

Christina Russell, Meghan Henderson, and Kayla Fontaine for all of their Hard work and determination during the
year. I would also like to thank Mr. D, Mrs. David, and Mrs. Vanderburg for their hard work, their patience, their

great ideas, for their guidance and for keeping us on track throughout the year.

Yearbook is a job that ressembles doing the dishes, everyone wants them done but few

Good luck to all the graduates, and to the future president. Keep working hard, and continue to provide fun new
activities to get everyone involved and don’t forget to smile!

and many Wednesday evenings recovering from the strain. The year got off to a brilliant
start with the new online program, and many times we couldn't believe how much stress
this new technology had caused. Unfortunately we screamed at each other in a few words
that we cannot include in this publication but we still somehow found a way to keep the
events of our meetings locked in the depths of the yearbook closet. Horrible screaming
moments aside the entire staff loved every moment of it. All in all we had an awesome
year, the deadlines were met, the book looks awesome, and we are happy to say that we
have turned the page on another chapter of our lives. With most of this years staff entering
their last year at Char-Lan we are going to need a few more recruits ready to bind their
hands together and help us preserve our High-School memeories to share with our grand
children. So next year when a friend says "Wanna come join yearbook with me?" grab two
to call
more friends and walk on down. You never know one day you just might get
yourself editor.

Examples of the Celtic Knot have been found dating back more than
1, 200 years, most notably as decoration in religious manuscripts

such as the Books of Kells and the Book of Durrow, from 800 A.D.
Though there are many different designs, they all have one thing in

common. The intricate interweaving of the lines form a loop . . . There
is no end. The Celts considered these knots to represent the
interconnectedness of life, things without beginnings or ends and the

ongoing spiritual journey.

The theme of “coming together” made me think of the Celtic Knot.

No matter where we go, how our lives twist and turn, rise or fall, we
are always connected to one another through our years at

High school is seen by most as a haven for the athletically gifted. Char-Lan
however, feels the
need to break free of this traditional view. Students portray dedicat
ion in studies, clubs and
balancing acts. This year 46 students in grades 9 through 12 were
awarded the Bronze
Medal-average between 80-84%. 20 students were awarded the Silver
Medal-average between

85-89%. 4 students earned an average above 90% and were awarded the
Gold Medal. 29 Merit
awards were distributed and 61 C. itizenship and Participation
awards were bestowed upon
deserving students. The highest award given during the ceremo
ny were the Academic
Achievement Plaques. This year Lindsay Below, Katie Byatte,
T yler MacDougall, and Vicky
Schaefer were the hard working individuals who
received this honour. Finally the Kara
MacDonald-Wolochatiuk Award was given to
Bernie McDonell and Vicky Schaefer who
demonstrated athletic ability and academic achieve
ment. Congratulations to all recipients.

For the Christmas season, our Chapter decorated an Angel Tree with the first names, ages and Christmas wishes of a number of area
children associated with the local Children’s Aid Society. The “angels” literally flew away as students and members of St. Andrew’s
United Church selected over 90 “angels” from the Angel Tree.

This event raised over $900.00.
** Our Chapter is pleased to announce that we have raised $6500.00 for the Brick by Brick School Building Program. Private donations
from the community and a generous $1000.00 donation from the MacGregor Investment at St. Andrew’s United Church has enabled our

A few tequilas later I could’ve sworn I was dead,
I went back to the hotel and passed out in my bed.
Being late for the bus was always a pain,
It felt like I had been hit by a train.

"T have no feud with Mr. Schulz. He is
a competent, patriotic gentleman, and I
do not know why he feels it has
anything to do with me." - Mr. Power

This year, Char-Lan had the great honour of
being graced by the presence of the British-born Mr.
Power. Our history teacher, Mr. Schulz, decorates his
room with the flags of many countries, along with
some provinces. The Vice Principal was quick to
discover and correct the fact that Mr. Schulz had had
the British flag upside-down for years. However, as
he did so, he felt the need to put the German flag
upside-down as well. Mr. Schulz, being of German
heritage, took this as a comical act of offense, and so
sparked the School Feud.
This patriotic competition continued, as Mr.
Schulz replaced the British flag with the Scottish one,
hiding the flag of Great Britain under one of his

numerous maps. Changing his screensaver to “Sink

Britannia,” Mr. Schulz went further, and invaded Mr.

Power’s office, leaving behind a German recruitment

poster, and the German flag in felt pen on his desktop

calendar. Mr. Power retaliated by leaving a note on
the map of Europe that the history teacher has that

read, “All this belongs to Great Britain. 1 OWN
THIS!” Finding the British flag after much efforts of

searching, Mr. Power exposed it, and replaced the
German flag with a poster. The German flag was

found the following day upside-down on the outside
of the glass windows down the library corridor, a

place locked and therefore accessible only to the

The title is taken from the chorus of Rule Britannia
by Thomas Aug ustine Ame. Captions: Top Left - Mr. Schulz's German flag is found upside-down 08 the

Mr. Schulz then took it upon himself to find a new place
for his British flag. That day, it was moved to the ceiling
before being placed backwards and upside-down on the
far wall for all to see. In revenge, British flags were put on
Mr. Schulz’s mailbox. At the time of writing, the most
recent event is the Health Inspection that Mr. Power
conducted on Mr. Schulz’s classroom, during which he
attempted to nail him for the British flag being
upside-down and backwards, and having an unreachable
cord as a tripping hazard, among other things.

doubt that these little comical indulgences will continue,

if only for the laughs it provides. As to the entire thing,

Mr. Schulz comments, “The English are 2 cast-off tribes
-- the Anglos and the Saxons. We threw them out 1000

years ago,” a quote that is only fitting for the school

history teacher.
However, when asked about the whole affair, Mr. Power
said, “I have no feud with Mr. Schulz. He is a competent,
patriotic gentleman, and I do not know why he feels it has
anything to do with me.” How true this is, is uncertain,
