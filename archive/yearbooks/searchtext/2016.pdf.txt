2015-16 was a year full of new
things. "Fender", a husky mascot
was created and introduced by

victory lap student Kate Schwariz.
Two new classes (dance and
personal fitness) were added to the
curriculum. Late buses were
provided on Tuesdays & Thursdays
to allow for more club and sport
participation. An archery club was
added to the athletics department.
A Learning Commons (revised
library) complete with comfy
couches, TV, and books was
created to provide a quiet social
area for student body to enjoy.
Students were provided with
numerous field trips and guest
speakers throughout the year.
