It was extremely hard to choose the cover for this year
the yearbook staff didn’t sleep or eat for four days contemplating this

important decision. We finally decided that Margaret Winn’s was the

coolest, but a sampling of the other amazing entries had to be included.

Principal's Message

Loe

“Never give in! Never give in! Never, never, never, never - in anything great, small,
large or petty - never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.”
Winston Churchill

Char-Lan is fortunate to have a yearbook to preserve the memories of the 20002001 academic year. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Year-book Committee, and the editors for their commitment, perserverence and dedication. They have worked tremendously hard, with little support and guidance in
producing this treasured time piece.
As I reflect on the past year, 1 am reminded of our special events and assemblies.
We enjoyed the festivities surrounding spirit week, winter carnival, and the sport-

|
H

ing events we participated in. Our orientation activities, achievment awards, and

special assemblies are memories well worth preserving.

In closing, I would like to extend my sincere best wishes to our graduates. May the
days you spent at Char-Lan allow you to be confident, cooperative and competent

in what ever you pursue.

Sincerely,

Frank Hummell

This Yearbook is dedicated to the
memory of:

Eric Cumming

There are times in life
when tragedy strikes. It
is never easy,
especially when it takes
the life of a loved one. At

the end of a trying
school year for both staff
and students, Eric was
taken from us, but his

memory will live on. He
will never be
forgotten and will

always be
remembered.
