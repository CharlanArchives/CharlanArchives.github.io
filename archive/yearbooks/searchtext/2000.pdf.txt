Another school year has passed and yet another phenomenal yearbook has been created by a group
of very talented and dedicated students. They have worked for months to ensure that this book
would be a permanent reminder of the people and events that made 1999-2000 school year so
memorable.

Our teams did not win all of their games but they were excellent ambassadors of our school. Our
clubs offered a wide range of experiences for a variety of student interests. Our band
went to
Disney World, the choir sounded like angels at the Christmas Concert and our Improv
team represented us with gusto in competition with much larger schools.

“The most important single
influence in the life of a
yerson is another person who
is worthy of emulation.”

All of this and much more has been captured between the covers of this
book. Enjoy it now and
then tuck it away in a safe place. Years from now you will no
doubt have occasion to take it from
the shelf and reminisce over the school year that was 1999-20
00.

Thanks again to those who made possible this collec
tion of memories.

Editor’s Message
WhatcanI say about the Crusader 2000 Yearbook? Perhaps I could write about
how it is stuffed with memories we will cherish for the rest of our lives, or how it
represents the start of a new era for our civilization (dare we say the word
“millenium”’??) Instead, I would like to say how incredibly proud I am of this
yearbook and of all the awesome individuals who dedicated themselves to
making it the best thatit could be! A special thank-you goes to Photography Editor
Lisa Campeau, who spent many hours organizing the necessary photo shoots,
Candice Bougie for her dedication during her spare time, Mrs. Wickware for all
her emotional support (Good Luck!), and also to Mr. Baitz for all his hard work,
and for allowing us to be as creative as we could possibly be!! Last but not least,
the Crusader 2000 would have been a complete bust if it weren’t for you, the

amazingly beautiful Char-Lan students, who allowed us to take your pictures

over and over (and over...and over...) again!!
Enjoy Your

Yearbook!
