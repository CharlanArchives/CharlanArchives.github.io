fly by! Whether this was your first year of high school, final year of

high school, or somewhere in between, I sincerely hope that it was a

memorable one. Student council worked hard to try to contribute to
the quality of your school year. Grant Vander Burg, Shauna Fontaine,
Kaitlin Proudfoot, and Tyler Spink, you four made it happen!
Congratulations on your hard work and enthusiasm this year! Mr. O,

guidance. To all the staff, thank you for putting up with us and our
crazy ideas! A special thank you to Mr. Danaher and Mr. Fielding,

because without your support, none of our ideas would have been put

into action.
Crusaders, you should give yourselves a pat on the back for all of

your sirit, without you, there would be no point in having what-not—
to-wear, pyjama, or crazy hat day!
Good luck to the future president, and thank you to all for ensuring
that I will never forget my year as student council president!
