This book is a time capsule cast on the uncharted seas of the future.

Mme N. Groulx, Miss S. Donnelly, Mrs. C. Love, Mrs. H. Lacelle, Mr. P. Oathwaite,
Mrs. K. Rorabeck, Miss S. Sinclair, Mrs. M.J. Ferguson

Words, events, faces and places have been sealed in it for posterity. In the future this book will

Absent from photo:

provide testimony to what life at Char-Lan was like in the 20th Century. Much has been immortalized: your friends, the crowded halls, your teams, the smile of a teacher who cared, this
wonderful school that has nurtured us through this past year.
Enjoy this time capsule and then tuck it away on a shelf, to be removed one day in the future when
the pages of this book will revive your memories and cause you to smile whimsically at what life
was like at school in the 20th Century.

And finally, to the Yearbook Committee, congratulations on a job well done. Thank you so much
for your efforts on our behalf.

Special thanks and good wishes to all those teachers who may be leaving or
retiring.
The knowledge, wisdom, experience and humour you have brought
into our lives has been invaluable. Good luck in the future.

Unreachable by the eye.
Wind is like a fine dancer

: not onl

Everyone must go through the journey,
Not sure of the direction.
There are many paths to cross

And others just to explore.
They are all there for a reason,

To create and shape our lives.
Our hearts have been broken,
Our minds have been taken over
And our souls are revealed to the unknown.
What has become of our identities?

Look deeper to a world beyond.
Through the eyes and beyond the reflection.
Look at the soul that has been revealed,

The heart that has been broken

And the mind that has taken over.

They are the simple answers
To the mystery of life.

According to my grandmother, the second important

more difficult for her. She walked three kilometers to school
everyday, even in the winter. When she arrived home from
school, she had to finish her homework and complete her
chores on the farm. Due to having a large family, she didn’t
get to finish her education. She often expresses her disappointment at not attending high school and college. The
opportunity never presented itself. I realize, from her past, to
take advantage of the chance I have and to continue my
education. This gives me confidence to achieve my goals.

Her past experiences have shown me that if I quit school, my

goal of becoming a surgeon will vanish.
As a result of all these cherished lessons, | have

learned many essential values. It’s extremely important to
work together as family, a community, a village. To respect, to

Kids Make A Difference

In my community, there are many areas which could use
help. However, the one area in which I am very interested in helping
is the lack of school textbooks and various supplies. I think we could
manage to raise enough money to buy new textbooks and increase our
budget for school supplies through a community dance-off.
| imagine that many people would contribute to such a cause
because they will want the best for their children. Teenagers will
probably attend this dance-off as well because everyone loves to dance!
We could have advertisers go around to the high schools to explain to
the children that a dance-off is a dance party in which you see who
can dance the longest throughout the night and most of all, to just
have fun and help support their school.
I think that, if we charge an admission fee and sell chips,
Coke and raffle tickets at the dance, we could raise sufficient funds to
at least start helping our school’s textbook and supply situation. If this
dance-otf were to be a success, I would gladly help out in organizing
another commuity event to help raise money so that our school
environment could be improved.

Outdoor - Ed

Despite difficulties that confronted them during the first
semester, Mme Leblanc’s Outdoor-Ed class managed to pull
together two outdoor adventures. In the fall, a hiking trip

to Algonquin Park was planned.

The students and their 2

leaders trekked for 3 days around the short loop of the
Highland Hiking Trail covering a distance of about 20 km.

The result was one or two aching muscles and a great
sense of accomplishment.

The only heat generated was by the students’
bodies as they vigorously snowshoed and built | ,

day exercise was a skate on the Rideau Canal.
