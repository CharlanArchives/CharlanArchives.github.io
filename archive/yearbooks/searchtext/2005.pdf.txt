As another year at Char-Lan comes to an end, I can’t help but feel saddened. Although my
time here at Char-Lan has been unforgettable, it is heartbreaking that many of my friends
will be going their separate ways. But even with this in mind, it is hard to forget all of the
good times and great memories that were born at Char-Lan. These past four years have
been the best of my life. To each and every student here, thank you for making Char-Lan a

nl

better place. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank administration and all of the staff for

their continuous support and uplifting spirits. You have made my job as President much
easier. I'd also like to send out a special thank-you to Mr. D, Mrs. Vander Burg, Mr.
Danaher, Maggie, Claude, and Christina for all of their contributions and efforts for
Student’s Council. Without all of your help, this year would not have been possible. With

likewise, why we love you. You

we sit here tonight, this celebration

is not only for us, but for you, for
succeeding at molding us into the

we are becoming. We may be the
graduates but the diplomas we’ve
received tonight are not only ours
but yours as well. This journey has
without a doubt been a combined
effort. In the words of Hodding
Carter Jr., “There are two lasting
bequests we can give our children.
One is roots. The other is wings.”
Our roots will always be here at
Char-Lan, within Glengarry but

have certainly come a long way
from hot dogs and locker combinations as we are in the process of

planning our future. The privileges
as graduating students could not
have made this year more memorable. The students vs. teacher
competitions, we unfortunately did

not win bragging rights, the

How Accidents Happen

He’s speeding down an icy road,
With no seatbelt strapping him down.
He doesn’t see the danger,
He’s headed straight for town.
There are kids playing road hockey,
Having fun and laughing too.
He speeds up a little more,

And bang! Out of the blue.

There is blood staining the earth,
There are bodies on the ground.
The medics rush to the scene,
To the remains left lying around.
They are too late to save them,
All of them are dead.
What was that driver thinking?
Why didn’t he use his head?

The families weep with tears,

Full of grief and pain.
Those people are lost forever,
That driver was insane.
Life will eventually move on.

By: Meagan Brown

All Alone
Lonely is the word I choose.
To describe the feeling and abuse.
All I wanted was to know why you left
me ail alone.
All alone to feel the pain.
The pain of memories long ago.
I want to tell you that I care and hope
to get back the love we shared.
Our love was strong.
Strong and bright.
So why did you leave without a fight?
A fight for love that would last.

Last forever and never pass.

But now I know that it’’s done,
And life isn’’t always fun.
I wish I could turn back the time.
The time when you were all mine.

She’d woken in the morning with a

Are you pro gamer, or just an observer,

Alarm clock wailing, the sound
unfailing,
A noise she’d learned to dread.

She could not wait, for she was late,

And the morning bus was slow.

When the clock struck twelve o’’clock,
it felt like it was four.

The piles of work ad the restless clerk

Made her long for something more.
A few steps more, she’’ll be at her

When suddenly, she hears a moan.
She quickly sees the source of the
melancholy sound.

That sound has a face, filled with

disgrace,

Its gaze lowered to the ground.
He hasn’t a home, or a dime to his
name, she thinks silently from within.
The she thinks of herself, and all of her
wealth,

And sees just how selfish she’s been.
Yes, some days are hard, some days are
long, and some days are ridden with

strife.

But now it’s her plan, because of that

To be thankful for each day of her life.

He said he loved me.
He said he cared.
He said he wouldn’t hurt me.
I said I loved him.
I said I cared.
I said I’d never hurt him.
I said I loved him and meant it.
I said I cared and meant it.

So all those things he said were lies.
He never loved me.
He never cared.

He hurt me more than anyone.
