2012,
ack four former gra9,dua
tes Char-Lan
of who are representing
Williamstown on a very large stage,
For the past two years , T'yson and Tylor

Spink have

played hockey as part of the Canada East team at the

World Junior A Challange. Christina Julien earned a
spot on the Canadian National Woman's Soccer team
as a striker. Christina and her teammates won gold
medals at the recent Pan Am Games in Guadalajara,
Mexico. Michael Robertson also participated in the
Pan Am Games as part of the Canadian National
Track and Field Team.
All of the athletes talked about the dedication,

willingness to work hard and the sacrifices they have

F made on the way to reaching their goal. They shared

| pictures and stories with the student body and made
| us feel as if we were part of the experience. Tyson and

Tylor spoke about how a group of hockey players
# became a unit in two short weeks through team

4 building exercises. Christina talked about how

f) amazing it was to represent Canada at the FIFA

§) World Cup in Germany in front of 80,000 fans. Most

_ of them were cheering for Germany but a small group
of about 100 fans were proudly waving their
Canadian flags. Michael shared his experiences of

running against people from all over the world at the
FISU Games in China, and at meets in such places as

@ New York City. They all feel so much pride that they
© wear the Canadian emblem, but they have never
m forgotten that their roots are here in Williamstown.

Vice -Principal’s Message

The time between beginning the first day of grade nine and
finishing the last day of grade twelve can sometimes seem
like a life time, especially on that very first day of high
school. | hope, as you look through the pages of Crusader
9011-2012, that you remember all the good times you've

enjoyed here at Char-Lan over the past few years. In years
to come, | hope this book makes you smile as you think

back to classes, clubs, sports, dances and just hanging oui

with friends in the hallways. | would like to congratulate the
yearbook committee for all its hard work to showcase the
wonderful year it’s been here at Char-Lan.

Congratulations to the graduating class of 2012! Best

wishes to all of you as you embark on a new series ot life’s
adventures and possibilities. Always remember to, "...have

the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they
somehow already know what you truly want to become.
— Steve Jobs
