Every Year Char-Lan raises money
for the Terry Fox Foundation for cancer research

It starts in a town far from here,
Where a group of Crusaders go year after year.
They pack their bags and leave Williamstown,
To go to the camp with the best spirit around.
Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 they are gone.
They drive all the way up always singing a song.

Some blue ones, some gold ones,
Some tall ones, some short ones.
These Crusaders come here to yell and to cheer.
They make some great stories year after year.
This is their camp,
This is Crusader Quest!

always. Many students find their niche in our wide variety
of clubs and activities. OSAID sells candy-grams and
lollipops to fundraise so their annual speaker will attend
Char-Lan. Free the Children raises awareness about world
issues and helps children help children, this year they are
building a school. The Chess Club ventures out to
tournaments and represents. Both Ecoschools and
Envirothon protect the local environment and develop new
and innovative ways to keep our school green. This year a
new group, SASS, emerged which calls upon all of the
musicians in Char-Lan to come on out and show off their
musical talent. Spirit Squad is always holding together
Our sports events and cheering on their fellow crusaders.
Prom committee managed to throw together fantastic
events that will be remembered for years to come. The
