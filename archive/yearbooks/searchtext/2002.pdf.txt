Mr. Blackadder is also one who
is noted for his friendly manner

Music is the Brandy of the Damned

Graduation Treasures

The years were great,

We had a blast,

It made us all remember our past.
We shared our memories,
Gained new thoughts,

Received our diplomas,

Reached the top.

Until this day,
Us few friends,
Thought our life together would end.
So this summer we'll keep in touch,
Maybe soon we'll have lunch.
The simple things that make our school great,

Will always be remembered, it’s our fate.

I will miss you,
Go live your life,

Just remember ours is nice.

Grades nine through twelve,

Made us close,

About our school, we deserve to boast.

Congratulations, on your victory!
Today we graduate,
You and me.

Our MC for the evening,
Mr. Ken Johns

It was overwhelming to look through old yearbooks, revisiting the memories of the last
five years. Our first official day as Crusaders was the traditional and much anticipated
Gr. 9 barbecue. Char-Lan must’ve known that the way to our hearts was through our
stomachs. That fall we quickly adopted the blue and gold colors as our own as we
traveled to the first of many victorious sporting events, concert band recitals and club
competitions. As for the photographs from those early days, | can assure you that we've
gotten better with age!

adulthood.” Not only are we tall enough to hang from the glass frame in the foyer now,

The choir had another great year under the

directionof choirmaster Mr. Johns. They performed
at both the school concerts. At the Spring Recital,

Teresa Renaud and Josee Giroux prepared a

' touching tribute to Mr. Johns, and sang a duet in

his honour.
The choir finished the year with a surprise retirement party for Mr. Johns. We will sincerely miss
him in the years to come.
